# '(in)Sanity' writeup

**Writeup author**: piprett (Norske Nøkkelsnikere)

We are told to visit [sanity.ept.gg](https://sanity.ept.gg). Here we need to login with Discord oAuth. After that, we are given a bash command to run to get the flag. Running this command will get the flag.

It is sketchy to run code you don't know what does, which is what the author is likely poking at. There is reason to believe that the author could see who ran the code blindly, and who tried to inspect what it does. For security reasons, we decided to run the command on our EPT Box.
